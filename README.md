# Smart Metals Data Visualization
Data visualizations and other useful metrics created from the dataset of pallets handled at Smart Metals Recycling. Use d3.js for visualizations where possible, but other ideas - even half-baked ones - are welcome.

## Formatting Submissions
See Example_Visualization for an example of how to format submissions. It is not required to follow the format. But a good submission will have:

1. Visualization (or metric)
2. A brief description of what the visualization is and how you think it will be useful
3. Display of code that you used to set the visual up
4. Display of how your data was formatted
5. Include name(s) of contributor(s)
